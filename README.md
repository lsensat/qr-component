## My process

I've started by building a pre-design/draft on Figma, to see how will more or less be. During the development on HTML/CSS I had to tune a bit the propotions of the card as well as the size of the fonts.

I had some trouble on centering the QR as well as the card and the text ".attribution" that is written below. I searched on the web, view a few videos and did it using flex attribute on CSS.

### Built with

- Pre-design on Figma
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I didn't now how to center an item and keep it responsive while changing the layout. Firstly, I practiced a bit with Figma, which I am new on it, helping me to sharpen the basics and see in minutes a good draft of the challenge.
I then just continued to develop the HTML with all the <sections> and <h> I could thing I had to manage and then I proceeded with CSS. With it, I dealed with the padding, position and display to finish up using "display: flex;".

### Continued development

I would love to deep dive a bit more on how CSS flex, seemed a very nice feature and a very fine attribute to have in mind when designing responsive websites.

### Useful resources

- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) - Helped me to understand a bit more how CSS flex works.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Helped me to understand some issues I had with git, as well as some check some post on centering items with CSS.
